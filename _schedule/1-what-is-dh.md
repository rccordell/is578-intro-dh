+ Meaningfully browse [_Reviews in Digital Humanities_](https://reviewsindh.pubpub.org) looking for projects that interest you: because of their topic, their methods, their institutional home, etc. To home in on likely projects of interest, you can browse by [time period](https://reviewsindh.pubpub.org/project-registry-time-period), [field of study](https://reviewsindh.pubpub.org/project-registry-field-of-study), or [topic or method](https://reviewsindh.pubpub.org/project-registry-topic-method). As you browse, jot down some general notes about trends you observe among the projects you see. Then, choose 1 review to read in detail. As you do, consider how this project fits (or does not) your ideas about "digital humanities" heading into this class. Be prepared to introduce your chosen project to the class, including details such as:
	+ Who are the project leads? Are they affiliated with particular institutions?
	+ Which field(s) does the project contribute to?
	+ What methods or technologies does the project employ?
	+ What are the project's major outcomes (e.g. datasets, code, maps, websites, exhibits, etc.)?
