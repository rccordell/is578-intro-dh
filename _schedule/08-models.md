## Discussion Topic

_The idea of "models" has already come up regularly in our readings and discussions, but with the rapid emergence of particular machine learning models, often glossed as "AI," over the past few years, it seems worthwhile to spend some time digging into both what we mean by "models" in a humanities context, and how particular models are used in DH research and teaching._
