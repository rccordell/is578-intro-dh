## Discussion Topic

_"What is digital humanites?" has been a perpetual question since the field emerged—so much so that many, [including your professor](https://dhdebates.gc.cuny.edu/read/untitled/section/31326090-9c70-4c0a-b2b7-74361582977e), have long been exasperated by it. DH is big and sprawling, to be sure, but in 2024 there have been (at least) twenty years of definitions, conferences, journals, and collections that we can use to sketch DH's broad commonalities, as well as to trace its distinct genealogies and communities of practice. For today's class, then, we'll not work to come up with a singular, universalizing definition—a task that would be challenge for **any** academic field—but instead to try and outline the evolving contours of the communities that have gathered under—or challenged, or rejected—the banner of "digital humanities" over the past two decades._

+ Meaningfully browse [_Reviews in Digital Humanities_](https://reviewsindh.pubpub.org) looking for projects that interest you: because of their topic, their methods, their institutional home, etc. To home in on likely projects of interest, you can browse by [time period](https://reviewsindh.pubpub.org/project-registry-time-period), [field of study](https://reviewsindh.pubpub.org/project-registry-field-of-study), or [topic or method](https://reviewsindh.pubpub.org/project-registry-topic-method). As you browse, jot down some general notes about trends you observe among the projects you see. Then, choose 1 review to read in detail. As you do, consider how this project fits (or does not) your ideas about "digital humanities" heading into this class. Be prepared to introduce your chosen project to the class, including details such as:
	+ Who are the project leads? Are they affiliated with particular institutions?
	+ Which field(s) does the project contribute to?
	+ What methods or technologies does the project employ?
	+ What are the project's major outcomes (e.g. datasets, code, maps, websites, exhibits, etc.)?

### Penumbra

_Remember, you should choose **one** penumbral reading to prepare in detail, based on your own interests and/or career goal(s), though you are of course free to read more. This week we have an especially large list because there have been so many introductions to DH. This is, if you can believe it, still only a sampling._
