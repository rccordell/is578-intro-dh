## Discussion Topic

_Since (at least) the rebranding of computational humanities scholarship as "Digital Humanities" in the early 2000s, there has been a strong association between the field and various forms of visualization: e.g. graphs, maps, timelines, and so on. This week we will investigate how digital humanists use such visual rhetoric, and how DH visualization might (or might not) differ from the use of similar figures in the sciences and social sciences._

### Group Activity

Each group is assigned a DH data visualization (or set of related ones). In your group, spend some time looking at the visualization and answer these questions:

1. Following Isabel Meirelles' dichotomy, is your group's visualization primarily "descriptive" or "argumentative?" 
2. What can you learn at a glance from the visualization itself, and what would require background reading or additional context to understand?
3. What can you discern from the visualization about its underlying data? 
3. Is this visualization accessible? Why or why not?
4. How would you describe the rhetoric of this visualization? Can you connect it with ideas from one of our readings?
