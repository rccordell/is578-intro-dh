## Discussion Topic

_Since (at least) the rebranding of computational humanities scholarship as "Digital Humanities" in the early 2000s, there has been a strong association between the field and various forms of visualization: e.g. graphs, maps, timelines, and so on. This week we will investigate how digital humanists use such visual rhetoric, and how DH visualization might (or might not) differ from the use of similar figures in the sciences and social sciences._
