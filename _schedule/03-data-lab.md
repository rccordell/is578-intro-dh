## Lab Topic

_We can't possibly cover all the ways DH projects conceive of and operationalize "data" in a single lab. Instead, we will focus on a discrete humanistic text-object that can be modeled and used in very different ways, through different data types, and toward different project purposes. Ultimately, our goal is help you think about a core set of questions that face every DH project, which are 1. what are this project's primary outcomes/deliverables (research, pedagogical, public)?; 2. what data type(s) will facilitate those outcomes?; and 3. what resources, staffing, and expertise will we need to create those data types from our source materials?_
