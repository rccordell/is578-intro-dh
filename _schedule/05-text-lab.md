## Lab Topic

_Today we will be joined by two guests, Avery Blankenship (PhD Candidate, Northeastern University English) and Jess Frye (PhD student, UIUC iSchool) who will share some of the text analysis methods they are using as researchers with the [Virality of Racial Terror project](https://viraltexts.org/2023/01/24/vrt/), which is part of the larger [Viral Texts project](https://viraltexts.org)._

### Instructions

#### Lab Task: Perform your own topic model analysis

The premise of this lab assignment is pretty straightforward:  use the [topic modeling tool](https://mimno.infosci.cornell.edu/jsLDA/jslda.html) we explored in lab this week to model the topics in the example corpora we did not directly use in class. In class we used the "race riot" and "white women" datasets; for your independent work you can use the "lynch" or "klan" data from VRT. OR, if you're feeling ambitious, consider preparing your own corpus for analysis following [the instructions here](https://mimno.infosci.cornell.edu/jsLDA/). The single biggest choice is how you delineate an individual "document" in your corpus, as this will dramatically influence which words are most strongly associated with one another in the model.
