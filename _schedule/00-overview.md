## Seminar Schedule Overview

This overview gives a top level view of the topics for each of our meetings. You can either use the side navigation or click on a topic to jump to that section.

Keep in mind that our weeks (mostly) alternate between discussion and lab sections. Please see the [discuss prep assignment]({{site.baseurl}}/assessments/3-discussion) for a detailed description of how you should approach the "Core" and "Penumbral" readings each discussion week.
