### Instructions

Hopefully, you've already downloaded [Gephi](https://gephi.org), but if not you will need it for today's workshop.

We will be using [Melanie Walsh's sample network datasets](https://github.com/melaniewalsh/sample-social-network-datasets/tree/master) today as well as data from the [_Mapping the Republic of Letters_](http://republicofletters.stanford.edu) project. I've gather the files [in this folder of our class repository](https://github.com/rccordell/is578-intro-dh/tree/gh-pages/public_course_data/network-data) for easy download. .

There are many kinds of visualizations in digital humanities work—graphs, charts, maps, trees, timelines, &c.—but today we'll focus on one: the network graph. Networks are used to analyze and visualize relationships. And though we often think of networks primary _as_ visualizations, this lab will seek to demonstrate how those visualizations are only one aspect—and often not the most important aspect—of a network analysis.

Building on our discussion of Benjamin Schmidt's argument in ["Do Digital Humanists Need to Understand Algorithms?"](https://dhdebates.gc.cuny.edu/read/untitled/section/557c453b-4abb-48ce-8c38-a77e24d3f0bd#:~:text=Put%20simply%3A%20digital%20humanists%20do,algorithms%20attempt%20to%20bring%20about.), we will discuss a number of key metrics from the field of social network analysis—e.g. degree, centrality, betweenness—with an eye toward understanding how they are computed from network data.
